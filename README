pycoverage.el
=============

An emacs mode for reporting on coverage stats for python

Installation
============

Load pycoverage.el


Install cov2emacs using setuptools or virtualenv or distutils

There should be ``.coverage`` file in your home directory.
``cov2emacslib/__init__.py`` looks for it.

Running
=======

M-x pycoverage-mode

M-x pycoveage-load-report

Ideal Usage
===========

One runs their tests using coverage.  Then they enter
``pycoverage-mode``.  That should look for a ``.coverage`` file (or
the twill equivalent) and load the overview/results page in another
buffer.  It will also highlight the current file (iff it's timestamp
is <= ``.coverage`` timestamp.  Newer timestamp means no guarantees on
output.) with coverage information.

Todo
====

  * Make it work!
  * Use missing line numbers instead of covered lines
  * Make pycoverage-load-report look for a ``.coverage`` file
    recursively up the parents of the file
  * Make ``cov2emacs`` accept location of ``.coverage`` file
  * Make report use normal coverage.py text output, since it's a
    little friendlier on the eyes (instead of reporting for every 
    group of lines in a file)
  * Twill support
  * Nose integration?
